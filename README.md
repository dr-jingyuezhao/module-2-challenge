# 02 Working With CSS Challenge: Portfolio 

## Description 

This project is to build a portfolio page, which we can add to as the course progresses.  
 
A portfolio of work can showcase the web development skills and talents to potential employers. An effective portfolio highlights our strongest work as well as the thought processes behind it. A portfolio with deployed web applications is very helpful for our career search. 

Because I don't have enough deployed web applications to showcase at this point, I have used the images and names in the mock-up example. I can change them to real applications as I create them later in the course.

This project needs to meet the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs as shown below:

* When the page is loaded the page presents your name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about you, your work, and how to contact you
* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* When viewing the section about your work then the section contains titled images of your applications
* When presented with the your first application then that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Installation
Not applicable.

## Usage 

* On the top of the page, it presents my name, and navigations to each section on the page, and a link to view my resume.  
* Click one of the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section: "About Me", "Work", "Contact Me"
* The "About Me" section is a short summary of my professional achievements 
* The "Work" section contains titled images of my recent web applications
* The first application is my most successful web application and displayed in a larger size than the others. Click on each project image, the user can be taken to that deplayed application
* The "Contact Me" section contains the information about how to contact me in different ways
